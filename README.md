Made this for a spam server, kinda W.I.P atm and threw it together really quick but ye xd, __**Also it has one major issue at the moment, other people may be able to trigger it which isnt allowed/supposed to happen in a self bot, so ye, i fix√© tho.**__ **So just use with caution and most probably change prefix atm**
